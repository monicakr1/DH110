# Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry
## DH 110, Monica Rhee

## Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
### - What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?
This project aims to support users who are looking for a easy and relatively comprehensive guide to start a vegetable garden at home while emphasizing the benefits of physical activity and better nutrition.

### - What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for physiological needs such as fresh air, food and health. It also may improve the need for esteem as it can develop a sense of strength, competence, independece and freedom in building and growing a vegetable garden.

### - What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
There are several traditional and current solutions that are offered or avaiable to satisfy this need. One traditional method is visiting the public library or a bookstore to find magazines or book for guidance. Another method involve learning from people who are already experienced in the process such a friend or relative. Youtube remains a popular option for a general audience who have access to a computer with proper bandwith. Lastly, some may resort to hiring a professional to avoid risks involved.

### - What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
One of the limitations that can be improved with the aid of digital technology is accessibilty to the information. For instance, not everyone has the network or financial needs to obtain the need. Also, for those who might have physical limitations will have an easier time accessing this information in their home.

## Step02: Target users 
I want to create a website for individuals, specifically adults, who are intersted in starting a hobby with the aim towards a more healthier lifestyle. Preferably, seniors who want to engage in a hobby that promotes them to be more active and independent. No expertise in necessary to get started.

## Step03: Research method
To gain a better sense of how I could create a website that is useful to different types of users, I conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, this session was conducted remotely over Zoom.

The session was broken up into the two categories as follows:

### (Participatory) Observation
I observed the user engage in two activities: look up information with the prospect of starting a hobby and navigating their site of choice to look up said information.
Looking up information: I asked the user how they might go about finding information on starting a vegetable garden if he was to embark on such a task.
Navigating site: I asked user how they generally use the site once becoming aquainted with the interface (do you use the menus, how much time is spent on the landing page, etc.)

### Interview
These were directive. I sought to understand alternative sources of information and the utility of media that the user engaged in their routine search.
>Because I could not find a target participant for this activity I had to ask a participant outside my intended audience to complete this activity.

### Insights from the Interview
On providing media as visuals
>Because sometimes it's just easier to show them to kind of write up to write up. So they might say, Hey, this is how you, you know, here, here's a video about this origami for for such and such for for, you know how you to make such a thing. And so the text itself gives you a better clarity of what's in the video, but you still need the video to do the show show part. 

Fun as an entry point for a hobby
>I do it for fun, and I don't, I don't really want to really, really spend that much time trying to try to perfect it.

General search habit
>Yeah, I might do Google first. And then maybe YouTube for kind of kind of show and tell.

On the functionality and frequency of use of menus once familiar with site
>I'm not all that often. I kind of like, also, what happens is that I kind of subscribe to stuff that I like already. And so I simply see what's here. And what what what YouTube recommends?

On seeking information on landing page before turning to search
>I might, I might, you know, I might do two or three. And if it doesn't, I might kind of go to Google.

## Step06: Reflection
Conducting the contextual inquiry and interviewing my participant gave me the opporutnity to step away from the product and focus on the user to gain a better understanding of how they navigate for information. While it was difficult to develop questions that inquired about the user's thought process and how they applied that to searching up to find out more about a partiular interest, shedding bias was even more difficult. However, this activity challenged me in a way to shift my perspective through the lens of a potential user. Unlike the usability testing, contextual inquiry provides a thick description of the goals that users have fashioning the product to serve them the most efficiently. I have learned that screening a variety of participants would broaden my view on the motivations and purpose when searching for information. Contextual inquiry required me to think critically and analytically whereas the usability testing seemed shallow in evaluating the true functionality of a site. During the early part of the interview the connection had dropped and I was unable to return to the same room. The particpant let me know that upon my disconnection he was kicked out of the zoom meeting thus needing to create a new meeting to the resume sesssion. Participant seemed to require more encouragement on certain explanations in order for me to fully grasp his train of thought.
