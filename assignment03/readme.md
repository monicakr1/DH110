# Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry
## DH 110, Monica Rhee

## Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
### - What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?
This project aims to support users who are looking for a comprehensive but streamline source of information to start a vegetable garden in order to engage in physical activity and incorporate a better nutrition.

### - What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for physiological needs such as fresh air, food and health. It also may improve the need for esteem as it can develop a sense of strength, competence, independece and freedom in building and growing a vegetable garden.

### - What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
There are several traditional and current solutions that are offered or avaiable to satisfy this need. One traditional method is visiting the public library or a bookstore to find magazines or book for guidance. Another method involve learning from people who are already experienced in the process such a friend or relative. Youtube remains a popular option for a general audience who have access to a computer with proper bandwith. Lastly, some may resort to hiring a professional to avoid risks involved.

### - What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
One of the limitations that can be improved with the aid of digital technology is accessibilty to the information. For instance, not everyone has the network or financial needs to obtain the need. Also, for those who might have physical limitations will have an easier time accessing this information in their home.

## Step02: Target users 
I want to create a website for individuals, specifically adults, who are intersted in starting a hobby with the aim towards a more healthier lifestyle. Preferably, seniors who want to engage in a hobby that promotes them to be more active and independent. No expertise in necessary to get started.

## Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
To gain a better sense of how I could create a website that is useful to different types of users, I conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, this session was conducted remotely over Zoom.

Describe your research methods and plan (step3)

## Step04: Observation / interview guide 
Decide where to visit
Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
Decide how to interact with the users 
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the interview guide (examples + template here -- this guide is designed for search activity but you need to edit with your contextual questions according to the activity, not search activity, you want to learn from the users)

Provide a link to your interview/observation guide (step4) 

## Step05: Conducting the research
Visit the place
Meet/Observe the user(s)
Collect the data (record, pictures, answered_survey)

Digitize your notes (scan/photo) and upload your data to github
Provide a link to your representative data file(s) (step5)
Provide a link to the transcript of your interview (or meaningful dialogues/ talk-aloud during observation, useful transcript tool here) 

## Step06: Reflection
