# Assignment 03: Contextual Inquiry
## DH 110, Monica Rhee

## Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
### - What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?
This project aims to support users who are looking for a easy and somewhat comprehensive guide to start a vegetable garden while emphasizing physical activity and the incorporation of better nutrition.

### - What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for physiological needs such as fresh air, food and health. It also may improve the need for esteem as it can develop a sense of strength, competence, independece and freedom in building and growing a vegetable garden.

### - What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
There are several traditional and current solutions that are offered or avaiable to satisfy this need. One traditional method is visiting the public library or a bookstore to find magazines or book for guidance. Another method involve learning from people who are already experienced in the process such a friend or relative. Youtube remains a popular option for a general audience who have access to a computer with proper bandwith. Lastly, some may resort to hiring a professional to avoid risks involved.

### - What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
One of the limitations that can be improved with the aid of digital technology is accessibilty to the information. For instance, not everyone has the network or financial needs to obtain the need. Also, for those who might have physical limitations will have an easier time accessing this information in their home.

## Step02: Target users 
I want to create a website for individuals, specifically adults, who are intersted in starting a hobby with the aim towards a more healthier lifestyle. Preferably, seniors who want to engage in a hobby that promotes them to be more active and independent. No expertise in necessary to get started.

## Step03: Research method
To gain a better sense of how I could create a website that is useful to different types of users, I conducted contextual inquiry. Due to current circumstances, this session was conducted remotely over Zoom.

The session was broken up into the two categories as follows:

### (Participatory) Observation
I observed the user engage in two activities: look up information on how to start gardening at home and purchasing materials for pickup or delivery
Looking up information: I asked the user how they might go about finding information on starting a vegetable garden if he was to embark on such a task.
Purchasing materials: I asked the user how they might find products or services online to check out or purchase.
Logging a book by hand: I asked the user what a book log entry would look like, if she were to record the books she read.
Finding a book in the Kindle store: I asked the user how she would find a book she wants to read from the website, and what she values when looking for a book to read.

### Interview
These were directive. I sought to understand alternative sources of information that users tapped into, besides the one shown in the observation period.

>Because I could not find another in-person participant for these activity, unfortunately I had to ask the participant from my usability test to complete these activities.
