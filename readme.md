# Gardening into Your Golden Years
## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
### DH 110, Monica Rhee

<b> Description </b>

Tending to a garden is one of the best ways to keep seniors active and engaged. It can aid in mobile dexterity, ease anxiety, improve mood and among other health benefits. I aim to apply Nielsen's 10 Heurisitics between two blog sites targeting individuals who seek a self-sufficient lifestyle particularly in the interest of gardening. My objective with UX design is to render a layout in a way that allows senior to gain accessibility to the information they need in a simple and efficient manner. 

## Severity Scale for Usability Problems

The following 1 to 3 rating scale can be used to rate the severity of usability problems:

| Rating	| Importance
| --- | ---
| 0 | I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all
| 1 |	Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

| Heuristics | EG Heuristic Evaluation | Improvement 
| --- | --- | --- 
| Visibility of System Status |  2- Text and icons change color when hovering. Content is not dated | Site can include dates or indicate when information was last updated
| Match between System & Real World | 2- Uses clear headlines and relatable copy that’s easy to understand | "View more" button at bottom of page should maintain original site to drop down to more content instead of loading a new page with the same content reorganized
User Control & Freedom | 1- Website functions within browser that usually offer universal controls | Option to mainpulate site like increase text would be helpful for sites targeting seniors however most if not all browsers offer that functionality
Consistency & Standards | 2- Some menu options create submenus while others do not and select options that do not mirror the extensive menu hidden within the menu icon | A single menu on top without submenus can simplify use as well as ridding of the hidden menu tree on the left
Recognition > Recall | 2- Social media icons are used instead of text for immediate recognition | When selecting another article from the options offered on the right the previous article making it difficult to return to article | A carousel option for these options that display in order might be helpful
Error Prevention | 1- When trying to subscribe user is not informed of error of invalid entry until after submission. User than is presented with more information to fill out rather the option to submit just an email address | Indicate key requirements for submission
Flexibility & Efficiency of Use | 2- After selecting post Menu can be mirrored at bottom of page instead of scrolling back to the top
Aesthetic & Minimalist Design | 3- Landing pages includes large pictures that make it hard to focus on a single object or direction | A single focus point is recommended or at least partition the information to follow standards that make it easy to follow
Help Users with Error | 2- When using search that does not produce results user is not given options other to reselect search in the top corner of page | Provide options to either reach out for help or at least some similar queries in the results
Help & Documentation | 3- Site does not include help or documentation but does include a vague option for "contact" where user can submit feedback. The "contact" page includes a unstructured FAQ. | Design options to encourage user to ask for help or extend a line of communication

| Heuristics | EG Heuristic Evaluation | Improvement 
| --- | --- | --- 
| Visibility of System Status |  0- Top of the page introduces an alert to reference new updates to policy. First post on page includes a recent date. Option selected is underscored | None
| Match between System & Real World | 0- Arrows pointing down to next to words enclosed with pictures drop down to open a menu | None
User Control & Freedom | 0- Alert on top is a constant reminder however user is given option to exit as noted by an x after statement | None
Consistency & Standards | 2- Some menu options create submenus while others do not and select options that do not mirror the extensive menu hidden within the menu icon | A single menu on top without submenus avoid confusions as well as the hidden menu trees on the left
Recognition > Recall | 1- Website within browsers offer universal forward, back and reload button. However the site itself has no option to recall previously viewed pages since browsers offer history | None
Error Prevention | 1- In the event of cancelling the option to seek help user is given the option to exit that is marked by an x enclosed by a circle near the sub title bar | Cancel button should be seen relatively close and clearly to submit button 
Flexibility & Efficiency of Use | 2- At the end of each post related keywords and articles are available as well as a bottom menu | When looking for a specific topic such as "gardening" suggested keywords and articles are not relevant
Aesthetic & Minimalist Design | 1- Good placement of images and font variation to distinguish menu and content help navigation | Less bold colors 
Help Users with Error | 0- Required entries for form are indicated with a visble red asterisk | None
Help & Documentation | 1- "How may we help" option remains visible and floating at all the times on bottom of page. | Popup takes up more than the visible space that may cause user to miss the exit option. Clicking outside of the popup does not close out of the popup.
