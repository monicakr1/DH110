# Assignment 02: Pilot UT
# DH 110, Monica Rhee

## Introduction
Morning Chores is a website aimed towards individuals who strive for and believe in a self-sufficent lifestyle. It offers a a collection of guides with information covering gardening, homestead, raising livestock and other various DIYs. The advice is intended for a general audience who collectively experience a similiar range of problems and field conditions but find it difficult to find a reliable source that is not anectdoal without being bogged down by in-depth details. 

After applying a heuristic evaluation with the website a few concerns arose regarding the usability of the site. Therefore, a usability test was performed with a participant to see what a user might encounter from day to day use. Generally, the test is conducted with more than one potential user in a usability lab, remotely, or on-site with portable equipment. Users are asked to perform a series of tasks. The purpose of this test is to improve the website from the user's perspective in order to draw and engage user's interest in using the site as their main guide in gardening for seniors. 

## Methodology
The test administrator contacted and recruited participant from a network of aquainted individuals who have elderly relatives living with to them or have close relations to one. Each session takes approxiamtely one hour. The test was conducting remotely on the participant's personal laptop at their home through the Zoom application. It was then recorded through the moderator's laptop. This is a pilot test in order to test the setting and the materials.

A link to the questionnaire was submitted via chat in the Zoom application for the participant to complete. The questionnaire consisted of several sections including: Â informed consent, pre-test questions, task-scenario, post-test questions and demographic data questions. Several factors were measure for such as ease of use and trustworthiness.

## Reflection
During this pilot usability testing I have come to notice that my response may very affect the user's responses. Given the user is someone I am already familiar with I would imagine that the ability to maintain a somewhat neutral expression while dispensing positive feedback was easier than if the participant was a stranger. Also, had a been the moderator for somewhat who had less patience or more difficulty with the challenges presented it would create for an uncomfortable experience for the participant as well as myself as the moderator. For future testing I would structure the questionnaire to be specific is fleshing out user errors and difficulties. Also, I would prepare a secondary or backup script in the event that I forget or cannot move through the usability testing smoothy.
