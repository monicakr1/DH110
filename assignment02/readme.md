# DH 110, Monica Rhee

## Introduction
Morning Chores is a website aimed towards individuals who strive for and believe in a self-sufficent lifestyle. It offers a a collection of guides with information covering gardening, homestead, raising livestock and other various DIYs. The advice is intended for a general audience who collectively experience a similiar range of problems and field conditions but find it difficult to find a reliable source that is not anectdoal without being bogged down by in-depth details. 

After conducting a heuristic evaluation with the website a few concerns arose regarding the usability of the site. Thus, a usability test was performed with a participant to see what a user might encounter from day to day use. 

Introduction with the name of the web/app + what the web/app is about. 

Report the rationale behind of UT with the list of the usability issues you found from your heuristic reviews

Indicate that the purpose of the usability testing aims to find out how to improve the web/app from the user's perspective.

## Methodology
The pilot usability test was conducting remotely on the participant's personal laptop at their home. Through Zoom, the test was conducted and recorded through the moderator's laptop. 

A link to the questionnaire was submitted via chat in the Zoom application for the participant to complete. The questionnaire consisted of several sections including: background questions, pre-test, post-test, tasks, SUS questionnaire and product satisfaction. 

Report that it is a pilot test (in order to test the setting and the materials).

Describe the process (ex. Background questions, pretest, posttest) and what was measured (ex. Ease of use)
