## Introduction

Golden Gardens is an endeavor to teach adults, primarily seniors, to grow anything anywhere with emphasis. The primary focus is to motivate them towards a hobby of growing their own vegetables as a way to upkeep their health and nutrition. This site offers guides, reviews and other resources to engage both beginners and more advanced gardeners. 

## Design Statement

While there are many resources catering to general gardening ideas, a dedicated one-stop-shop for all things gardening is missing. Many of these sites are offered in the form of a blog entry without real useful media to show users the basic steps in the instructions. In an effort to mesh tips with actual how-tos, adults of all levels can use Golden Gardens as a point of reference for all things related to gardening. 

## Competitor Analysis

In this step of the project a heuristic evaluation was conducted on two similar websites. Generally, these evaluations are conducted by multiple experts but given the circumstance and time constraints only one was conducted. From this evaluation a low severity rating was issued due to poor organization of information and lack of robust features. In the usability testing I observed how users might interact with the interface and asked them questions regarding the trustability of the site and features it might be lacking. At this point, I brainstorm some ideas on how to improve on these features to help my target user.

## User Research 

Following the competitor analysis by way of heuristic evaluation and usability testing, a contextual inquiry is performed. This research method allows me to step away from potential biases and see through the perspective of the user. I was led by users through observation and activity. Based on the tasks that I had users perform, I understood how my target user might go about finding information and using that information to put it into practical use.

## UX Storytelling
6) UX storytelling
From ideation comes storytelling, and in this process design ideas are narrowed down based on the information communicated to the users. I created two personas (John & Janet) based on what my target audience might entail. This method is necessary to induce a perspective shift so I am better able to make decisions in the process. An empathy map and user's journey are developed to gain a better understanding of the "how" and "why" in terms of the user's goals.

## Low-fidelity prototype
8) Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment06)
A low-fidelity prototype offers a low-grade schematic that offers the main features that I found to be helpful to the target users. Based on the heuristic evaluation and usability testing I was able to identify some of the frustrations and difficulties surrounding current iterations of a gardening website. With this information I then drew with a pencil and paper a rough sketch that would outline a simple wireflow from feature to feature. I then test the flow and functionality of the website against a user to see how they might navigate through the website.

## High-fidelity prototype
9) High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
High-fidelity prototype adds a visual and interactive component to the low-fidelity prototype. In this process, design elements are overlaid on to or created from the sketch. This prototype demonstrates the functionality of wireflows that is incorporated into the wireframes. These functionalities are tested on screen as users are able to branch into different options without any discontinuity.

## Conclusion
I have learned throughout the course that user experience is not merely based on intuition and actual research methods must be conducted to design optimal products. Getting feedback from actual users is critical to the success of the outcome. While designing features and components, a constant decision needed to be made that weighed between value and simplicity. Tradeoffs were constantly being made given the limited real estate given on a screen. Lastly, user experience is more than just a pretty design but instead relies on the flows and states to make information architecture fluid and effective.
