# User Interface (UI) Design: High Fidelity Prototype (Part1: Yellow)
## DH110, Monica Rhee

### Description
My project provides a visual and extensive guide for both new and current hobbyists of gardening. The purpose of this project is to engage users in an easy-to-follow format that encourage users to return using the platform based on usability. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the prototype is to provide visual context and an element of interaction within a limited amount of screen space. Thus, the designer needs to carefully curate which components best suits the needs of the user where they will engage in an interaction flow that should have a clear pathway.

### Process
During this process I will consider and evaluate several design ideas that will be based on the input and feedback of the user. The prototye allows me test the design will communicating the purpose to the user. After testing, I am able to reflect on the factors that impact the flow and space of the design.

### Supported tasks
- Searching and asking for help
