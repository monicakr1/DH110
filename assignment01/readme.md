# Elderly Gardening: Growing Gracefully into the Golden Years
## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
### DH 110, Monica Rhee

<b> Description </b>

Tending to a garden is one of the best ways to keep seniors active and engaged. It can aid in mobile dexterity, ease anxiety, improve mood and among other health benefits. I aim to apply Nielsen's 10 Heurisitics between two blog sites targeting individuals who seek a self-sufficient lifestyle particularly in the interest of gardening. My objective with UX design is to render a layout in a way that allows senior to gain accessibility to the information they need in a simple and efficient manner. 

## Severity Scale for Usability Problems
The following 1 to 3 rating scale can be used to rate the severity of usability problems:

| Rating	| Importance
| --- | ---
| 0 | I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all
| 1 |	Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

| Heuristics | EG Heuristic Evaluation | Improvement 
| --- | --- | --- 
| Visibility of System Status |  3- Text changes color when hovering. Content is not dated | Site can include dates of articles or indicate when last updated
| Match between System & Real World | 1- Social media icons blend in with menu  | Users will be able to quickly and identify social media icons from rest of menu if colored or not as linear with text menu options 
User Control & Freedom | 3- No option is offered to cancel or return when attempting to leave the subscribe page. Also no feature is offered to return to previous article when proceeding to next | Support user features to undo and redo
Consistency & Standards | 2- Some menu options create submenus while others do not and select options that do not mirror the extensive menu hidden within the menu icon | A single menu on top without submenus avoid confusions as well as the hidden menu trees on the left
Recognition > Recall | 3- When selecting another article from the options offered on the right the previous article is nowhere to be found making it difficult to retrace that information | A carousel option for these options that display in order may be helpful
Error Prevention | 1- When trying to subscribe user is not informed of issue until after submission. User than is presented with more information to fill out rather the option to submit just an email address | Ensure the experience in subscribing is uniform across the board
Flexibility & Efficiency of Use | 2- Menu presented in icon in the top right do not quite mimic the options listed on the top of page. Some offer a drop down menu while other do not; lacking in consistency | Top menu options can provide more common sought items instead or a completely different set from the menu option on the left 
Aesthetic & Minimalist Design | 3- Landing pages includes large pictures that make it hard to focus on a single object or direction | A single focus point is recommended or at least partition the information to follow standards that make it easy to follow
Help Users with Error | 2- When using search that does not produce results user is not given options other to reselect search in the top corner of page | Provide options to either reach out for help or at least some similar queries in the results
Help & Documentation | 3- Site does not include help or documentation but does include a vague option for "contact" where user can submit feedback. The "contact" page includes a unstructured FAQ. | Design options to encourage user to ask for help or extend a line of communication
