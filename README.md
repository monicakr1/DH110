# Elderly Gardening: Growing Gracefully into the Golden Years
## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
### DH 110, Monica Rhee

<b> Description <b>

Tending to a garden is one of the best ways to keep seniors active and engaged. It can aid in mobile dexterity, ease anxiety, improve mood and among other health benefits. I aim to apply Nielsen's 10 Heurisitics between two prominent websites/blogs that target those seeking self-sufficiency particularly gardening. My objective is to provide suggestions for a format more accessible for seniors and the users at large by facilitating the navigation of information presented.
