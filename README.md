# Elderly Gardening: Growing Gracefully into the Golden Years
## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
### DH 110, Monica Rhee

<b> Description

Tending to a garden is one of the best ways to keep seniors active and engaged. It can aid in mobile dexterity, ease anxiety, improve mood and among other health benefits. I aim to apply Nielsen's 10 Heurisitics between two blog sites targeting individuals who seek a self-sufficient lifestyle particularly in the interest of gardening. My objective is to suggest formatting that may render these sites to be more accessible for seniors and the users at large.

## Severity Scale for Usability Problems
The following 1 to 3 rating scale can be used to rate the severity of usability problems:

| Rating	| Importance
| --- | ---
| 1 |	Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
