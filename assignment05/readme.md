Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow)
Please have one page github documentation about your low-fidelity prototype:

A brief description of your project and purpose of this low-fidelity prototype.

A list of tasks that the (paper) prototype of your system supported.

A set of pictures of the prototype in different states, showing it being tested.

A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two about what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.
