# 05: Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow)
## DH110, Monica Rhee

## Description
My project aims to improve upon the usability and navigation of a site so that it caters to the target user demographic. I intend to create a layout in which both novice and veteran users will feel that is efficient and easy to use. The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to provide context and a visual outline to how I intend to accomplish this goal.

## Tasks
The low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:

1. Visual navigation of guides
2. Select from menu options
3. Ask for help in any part of the site
4. Input search field
5. Scroll articles based on latest updates

## Reflection
A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two about what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.
