# 05: Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow)
## DH110, Monica Rhee

## Description
My project aims to improve upon the usability and navigation of a site so that it caters to both novice and veteran users. The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to provide context and a visual outline to how I intend to accomplish this goal.

## Tasks
A list of tasks that the (paper) prototype of your system supported.

## Pictures
A set of pictures of the prototype in different states, showing it being tested.

## Reflection
A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two about what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.
