# 04: Persona+Scenario

## Purpose of UX Storytelling
The importance of storytelling is to gain perspective from a user's point of view. This user-centered approach allows for developers and teams to define users and create stories around them and their goals. Through this method can the different ways in which a product can be used be evaluated and be able to shed biases, conflicts and pain points to connect designers on a better insight and understanding of the user.

## Design Features
I identified two features of the website to improve upon based on prior heuristic evaluation.
1. the  website's organization and of menu and content
2. help or faq feature
