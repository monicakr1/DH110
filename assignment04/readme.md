# 04: Persona+Scenario
## DH110, Monica Rhee

## Purpose of UX Storytelling
The importance of storytelling is to gain perspective from a user's point of view. This user-centered approach allows for developers and teams to define users and create stories around them and their goals. Through this method can the different ways in which a product can be used be evaluated and be able to shed biases, conflicts and pain points to connect designers on a better insight and understanding of the user.

## Design Features
I identified two features of the website to improve upon based on prior heuristic evaluation.
1. the  website's organization and of menu and content
2. help or faq feature

## Scenario + Journey map (per each feature)
### Janet’s Scenario 

***Why?*** Janet has recently retired as a teacher because she wanted to focus better on her physical and emotional health. She has been listless and it has been harder to keep up with her students in class. She figures it is just due to age and spending most of her time indoors, but she decides to see a doctor shortly after for a routine checkup. There, Janet discovers that she has mild mobility issues and is recommended to start with some routine exercise to be practiced regularly at home. She quickly loses motivation but decides that redirecting her energy to her backyard might prove to be more productive. Janet’s grandkids, who are now in middle and high school, recently shared some of the produce they had grown with their mom after simply searching online for the information. 

***How?*** Janet decides to forgo a trip to the library as she wants some quick and easy answers about gardening. So, she fires up her desktop and goes to Google and types in “gardening for seniors” to find the leading online gardening guide as the first result. She clicks on it to find a menu at the top that lists a few options to get her moving in the right direction. However, she does not find exactly what she is looking for in those few options, but she proceeds with selecting the closest option. The next page that loads offers a list of options but finds that they are categorized into groups like a visual menu. She is able to immediately identify what she is looking for and even prints some of the information for future reference.

### John’s Scenario

***Why?*** John currently manages two properties but now that he has filled the last vacancy at one of the properties he can look forward to renovating his backyard that he has been putting on hold. He can never back down from an opportunity to start a new project and is meticulous about his craftsmanship. The guilt of neglecting his backyard propels John towards the ambitious goal creating a raised garden bed as the main focal point of his yard. His wife has been wanting to harvest their own produce, John has been wanting to put his vision and hands to work. 

***How?*** John has been experiencing problems with workers at big box stores who have expressed some level of incompetence. He feels that he can source the information himself by simply searching online for a how-to guide. John finds the website he is looking for and aside from the general steps on collecting the material and cost involved, he discovers that the site included visual tutorials that allowed him to skip through scrolling an endless amount of text. In addition, he finds that a help feature is available to him. Normally, John does not like asking for help especially his recent experiences but his curiosity got him to direct his attention to the help feature. It appears to be a chat feature with an automated response feature and he finds himself relieved not having to scroll through blocks of text looking for an answer.
